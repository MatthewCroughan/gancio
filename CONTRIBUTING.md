# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Gancio!

Building software means taking a stand, making decisions, choices.
These choices start from a precise look at reality, from specific needs and ends implementing specific features, choose default values, simplify some flow and patterns while making difficult others.

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs
- Translating the plugin into various languages
- Contributing code by fixing bugs or implementing features
- Improving the documentation
- Proposing ideas for new features


## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [Framagit Issues](https://framagit.org/les/gancio/-/issues).  
Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Translations

You can submit translations via [weblate.org](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gancio/). Note that if you want to change some label for your own instance [you can](https://gancio.org/install/config#user-locale).


## Pull requests

**Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests.** Unless the pull request is about refactoring code or other internal tasks, assume that the person reading the pull request title is not a programmer but an user and **try to describe your change or fix from their perspective**. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the main branch will carry the title of the pull request, and commits from the main branch are fed into the changelog. 
Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your commit messages.


**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.
