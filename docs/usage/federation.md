# Federation

Gancio is a federated application. This means that it can interact with other federated applications, such as Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica, WordPress, Mobilizon, etc.
This interaction is possible thanks to the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol.


##### Following a Gancio website from the Fediverse

If federation is enabled (`Admin > Federation > Turn on Federation`, true by default), you can follow a Gancio website directly from any other compatible website.
