## Federation / ActivityPub

Each instance has only one [AP Actor](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actors) of type `Application` named `gancio@instance.tld` that publishes each event.
We are considering the introduction of other `Actor` but they will not be linked to users, rather to places or tags/categories.
There are no personal homes with a timeline of people you follow, everyone has a sort of local timeline of the instance, itâ€™s an anti filter-bubble feature.
