##  Nginx proxy configuration
This is the default nginx configuration for gancio, please modify at least «YOUR_DOMAIN». Note that it does not include HTTPS setup but you can easily use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for that.

- __You should be in the correct directory__
`/etc/nginx/sites-available`

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name <<YOUR_DOMAIN>>;

  keepalive_timeout    70;
  sendfile             on;
  client_max_body_size 80m;

  location / {
    try_files $uri @proxy;
  }

  location @proxy {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:13120;
  }
}


```

- __Following this, you should create a link to the file in sites-enabled:__
```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-config> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
